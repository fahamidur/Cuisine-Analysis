### Motivation
Food is one of the most universal aspects of culture, yet recipes and nutrition data are often scattered across different sources. I wanted to bring this information together in a structured way and uncover meaningful insights. By scraping a cuisine website, analyzing the data, and visualizing it in Tableau, this project aims to highlight cuisine trends, nutritional patterns, and ingredient usage in a way that is interactive, insightful, and easy to explore.

### Background 
With the rise of global food delivery apps and recipe-sharing platforms, cuisine data has become both abundant and diverse. However, much of this information remains unstructured and difficult to analyze. This project was created to bridge that gap by scraping recipes, ingredients, and nutritional details from a cuisine website, cleaning and analyzing the data, and then building an interactive Tableau dashboard. The goal is to better understand cuisine trends, compare nutritional values across dishes, and explore ingredient usage in a clear and visual way

# Project Overview

This project collected, processed, and analyzed international cuisine recipes from **AllRecipes.com** to uncover insights about global cooking patterns, nutritional trends, and cultural differences in food preparation.


### 1. Data Collection
- Scraped recipe metadata (name, cuisine, link) for **2100+ international cuisines**.
- Extracted detailed recipe information including:
  - Preparation time  
  - Servings  
  - Ingredients  
  - Nutrition facts (calories, fat, carbs, protein)  
  - Ratings and review counts  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data formats.  
- Standardized units (e.g., removed `g` from nutrition values).  
- Parsed and converted time strings into **minutes**.  
- Cleaned and lemmatized ingredient names using **NLP techniques**.  
- Mapped cuisines to their respective **countries**.  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Identified **primary ingredients** using fuzzy matching.  
- Flagged presence of food groups (meat, seafood, dairy, vegetables, etc.).  
- Counted the **number of ingredients per recipe**.  

### 4. Data Export
- Saved the final cleaned and enriched dataset as:  
  - `final_dataset.csv`  
  - `final_dataset.xlsx`  

### 5. Tableau Dashboards

To visualize and explore the enriched dataset, four interactive Tableau dashboards were created:

#### 1. Nutrition at a Glance
- Highlights **highest and lowest nutritional values** of recipes at a glance.  
- Interactive **map** showing calories by country.  
- **Stacked bar chart** comparing average carbs, fat, and protein across countries.  

#### 2. Popular Recipes
- **Cooking time vs. average rating** visualization.  
- **Average rating vs. servings** for top 10 countries.  
- **Top 10 cuisines by rating**.  
- **Distribution of cooking times** (minutes) across cuisines.  

#### 3. Nutritional Deep Dive
- **Ingredient distribution** for the top 10 recipes by rating.  
- **Top 3 cuisines** ranked by average number of ingredients used.  
- **Nutritional composition of cuisines** by rating.  
- **Calorie distribution** of the top 5 countries (box plot).  
- **Protein distribution** of the top 5 countries (box plot).  

#### 4. Ingredient Impact
- **Average calories** of cuisines with/without meat (bar chart).  
- **Average fat** of cuisines with/without dairy (bar chart).  
- **Average protein** of cuisines with/without seafood (bar chart).  
- **Correlation heatmap** between ingredients and nutritional values.

# Tableau Dashboards
## Dashboard 1: Cuisine Analysis

![Cuisine Analysis](screenshots/dashboard-1.PNG)

**Description**  
This dashboard provides a global analysis of cuisine nutrition, highlighting calorie, fat, carb, and protein distributions across countries and recipes.  

**Visualizations & Features**  
- KPI cards showing highest/lowest calorie, fat, and carb cuisines.  
- World map displaying average calories by country.  
- Bar chart comparing average nutrients (carbs, fat, protein) across countries.  
- Tabs for exploring different perspectives (Nutrition, Popular Recipe, Nutritional Deep Dive, Ingredient Impact).  

**Insights**  
- "Codfish with Cream" is the highest-calorie and highest-fat cuisine, while "Simple Cajun Seasoning" and "Amish Friendship Bread" are on the low end.  
- Countries vary significantly in calorie density, with certain regions (e.g., U.S., Europe) showing higher averages.  
- Carbs make up the largest proportion of nutrients in most countries, followed by fat and protein.  


## Dashboard 2: Recipe Popularity

![Recipe Popularity](screenshots/dashboard-2.PNG)

**Description**  
This dashboard explores recipe popularity by analyzing ratings, cooking time, and serving patterns across cuisines and countries.  

**Visualizations & Features**  
- Scatter plot of cooking time vs. average rating, sized by recipe popularity.  
- Bar chart showing the distribution of cooking times across recipes.  
- Treemap of top 10 countries by average rating and servings.  
- Pie chart of the top 10 cuisines by rating.  

**Insights**  
- Most recipes are completed within 60 minutes, with fewer recipes requiring extended cooking times.  
- Higher-rated recipes tend to cluster between 4â€“5 stars regardless of cooking time, suggesting rating is less dependent on prep duration.  
- Denmark, Australia, and Norway appear among the top countries for high-rated and widely served recipes.

## Dashboard 4: Ingredient & Nutrition Impact

![Ingredient & Nutrition Impact](screenshots/dashboard-4.PNG)

**Description**
This dashboard explores how the presence of specific ingredients (meat, dairy, seafood, grains, etc.) impacts the nutritional profile of cuisines. It also highlights the relationship between cooking complexity (time and ingredient count) and nutrient distribution.

**Visualizations & Features**

* Bar charts comparing average calories (with/without meat), average fat (with/without dairy), and average protein (with/without seafood).
* Scatter plot showing the relation between cooking time and number of ingredients, with labeled standout recipes (e.g., Chef Johnâ€™s Mulligatawny Soup, Puerto Rican Sancocho).
* Correlation heatmap between ingredient categories (dairy, fruit, grain, herb, meat, seafood, spice, vegetable) and nutrient measures (calories, carbs, fat, protein).

**Insights**

* Meat significantly increases calorie content in cuisines (456 vs. 355 average calories).
* Seafood-rich recipes tend to have higher protein levels (21.19 vs. 18.65 average protein).
* Dairy has only a minor effect on fat content (19.53 vs. 18.61 average fat).
* Chef Johnâ€™s Mulligatawny Soup and Puerto Rican Sancocho stand out as highly complex, ingredient-heavy dishes.
* Correlation analysis shows:

  * Meat has the strongest positive correlation with protein (0.55) and calories (0.35).
  * Vegetables and herbs contribute moderately to protein content.
  * Grains correlate most strongly with carbs (0.30).
  * Spices show minimal direct nutrient impact.
